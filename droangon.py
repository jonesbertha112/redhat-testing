I’d rather be coding.The worst part of coding is explaining it to non-coders.Programming is just writing instructions for a very dumb computer.The first step in optimization is not to do it.Git happens.Errors are just opportunities to learn.Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable from a feature.Programming is thinking, not typing.Fix one bug, introduce two more.Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException.Refactoring: because nothing is perfect.A programmer’s life: Eat, Sleep, Code, Repeat.If it works, don’t touch it.Programming is a journey, not a destination.If it works, don’t touch it."Temporary" workarounds become permanent.Console.log(“Hello, debugging!”);Trust the process, but verify the output.Whitespace matters.Never trust a programmer who claims their code is bug-free.Code speaks louder than words.Programming is like writing a book… except if you miss a single comma, the whole thing crashes.Programming is like writing a book… except if you miss a single comma, the whole thing crashes.Good software is like a good joke—it needs no explanation.Refactoring: because nothing is perfect.Fix one bug, introduce two more.A single missing semicolon can ruin your whole day.Your code is only as good as your last commit.Coding is 1% writing and 99% debugging.A day of debugging can save you an hour of planning.Documentation is a love letter to your future self.There are two kinds of programmers: those who break things, and those who fix things.A programmer is a machine that turns coffee into code.Without tests, it’s not a bug, it’s an undocumented feature.Programming is an art.Debugging is fun… until it’s not.The best debugging tool is a good night's sleep.Automate everything.If code comments are longer than the code, you’re doing it wrong.Coding is 1% writing and 99% debugging.One does not simply write good commit messages.The best code is no code at all.Code without purpose is just wasted keystrokes.Console.log(“Hello, debugging!”);A good developer never stops learning.Fix it until it breaks.Git happens.Spaghetti code: Now serving technical debt.Commit often, push regularly, and hope for the best.Code fast, break things.Readability counts.The real challenge in programming is working with other developers.Spaghetti code: Now serving technical debt.Programming is the closest thing we have to magic.Roses are red, violets are blue, I lost a whole weekend debugging this issue.Syntax matters. Ask anyone who’s used Python.There are two types of people: those who understand binary, and those who don’t.Software engineering is just applied laziness.Code like there is no tomorrow.Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException.If code comments are longer than the code, you’re doing it wrong.The only constant in software development is change.Hello, world!droangon.py
